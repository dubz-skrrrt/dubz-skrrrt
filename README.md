### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Lyle, I am an inspiring Game Developer. I passionate about creating games from coding to making game concepts and designing!

I am a graduating student in [Malayan Colleges Mindanao](https://mcm.edu.ph). I'm also a former volunteer as a game caster in school events and in PSITS-XI! 
I have also participated in a few game jams which was a great experience as a game developer!
